# Calorie-Counter
Calorie Counter in C++

Very basic calorie counter app. I was taking a C++ course and was an avid gym goer at the time so I decided to make a Calorie Counter for myself. 
If interested in checking out the source code, I used DEV C++ editor (Free Software) to create the program. 

STEPS TO RUN PROGRAM:
1) Double click "Calorie Calculator.exe" and it will run in the command window.
